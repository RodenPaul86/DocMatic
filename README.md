## Motivation

<p>
There are a lot of note-taking apps available out-there, but only a few that do it well. Well, Noto is one of them.

The goal of Noto is to be a minimalistic, free, and open-source note-taking application that meets the user's
expectations, with privacy in mind.

Noto is also part of my [portfolio](https://paulrodenjr.org) projects. It showcases my skills regarding software development.

Thank you!
