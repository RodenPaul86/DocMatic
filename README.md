## Motivation

<p>
There are many document-scanning apps available, but only a few that truly get it rightâ€”DocMatic is one of them.

DocMatic is designed to be a fast, intuitive, and privacy-focused document scanner that meets usersâ€™ expectations without unnecessary complexity.

As part of my [portfolio projects](https://paulrodenjr.org/#projects). DocMatic showcases my expertise in iOS development, combining powerful features with a seamless user experience.
